## Part 1-A (Classification – ‘cifar10’ dataset)
  
  
###### Dataset:
**‘cifar10’** - Dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

###### How to run:
-> Run the executable file ap_assignment-2_cifar10.py.
-> Check the output.

###### Dataset and Program file structure:
**‘ap_assignment-2_cifar10’**: Parent file for reading dataset and applying I_ELM algorithm.
**‘ielm_cifar10.py’**: Defines I_ELM class along with classification training methods and testing methods.

###### Libraries:
1.) **numpy**: Python libraries multidimensional arrays and matrices.  
2.) **keras**: Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. Used for Dataset extraction.
